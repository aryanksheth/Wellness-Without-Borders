            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>A shortage is defined by a period of time when a countryâ€™s demand for a device surpasses the supply.
                However, the FDA has acknowledged that there are circumstances of regional supply delays, even if
                the demand does not exceed the supply (FDA).</p>
<section id="causes">
    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <h3>Legal</h3>
    <p>Laws, policy regulation Section 506J of the FD&C Act. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted,
        adding Section 506J to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This new section
        mandates that manufacturers inform the FDA about any permanent halt or significant interruption in
        the production of certain devices that could substantially impact the domestic supply.</p>
    <p>According to the law, the requirement for "506J notifications" is only in effect during or in
        anticipation of a declared public health emergency. Since the COVID-19 public health emergency ended
        on May 11, 2023, the FDA no longer expects manufacturers to submit these notifications for devices
        deemed critical during that period. However, the FDA accepts and encourages device manufacturers to
        voluntarily report any interruptions or discontinuances in manufacturing, even outside of declared
        public health emergencies, as this information is crucial for preventing and managing disruptions in
        the supply of essential devices (FDA).</p>
        <h3>Management/Production</h3>
        <p>Cost cutting, manufacturing and quality problems, geopolitical issues.</p>
        
        <h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>
        <p>Natural disasters, delays, public health emergencies, and discontinuations (COVID). The recent
            shortages of small volume parenteral (SVP) IV fluids were driven by the manufacturing disruption
            from Hurricane Maria superimposed on reduced supply due to manufacturer quality issues. The reduced
            supply of SVP products, including normal saline, led to widespread disruption in the delivery of
            healthcare in the US and globally as these products are used for hydration and preparation of
            numerous additional widely used medications.</p>
        <p>Until 2017, all 0.9% Sodium Chloride IV bags, also known as Saline Bags, which are required for all
            patients admitted into the emergency rooms were produced in Puerto Rico. However, in 2014, the U.S.
            experienced a nationwide shortage of IV solutions, specifically saline large volume intravenous
            solutions. Manufacturers blamed supply disruptions on plant shutdowns for routine inspection and
            upgrades. The main manufacturer, Baxter International, went south.</p>

                        <h2>Definition</h2>
                        <p>A shortage is defined by a period of time when a countryâ€™s demand for a device surpasses the supply.
                            However, the FDA has acknowledged that there are circumstances of regional supply delays, even if
                            the demand does not exceed the supply (FDA).</p>
                    </section>
        
                    <section id="causes">
                        <h2>Causes</h2>
                        <h3>Legal</h3>
                        <p>Laws, policy regulation Section 506J of the FD&C Act. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted,
                            adding Section 506J to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This new section
                            mandates that manufacturers inform the FDA about any permanent halt or significant interruption in
                            the production of certain devices that could substantially impact the domestic supply.</p>
                        <p>According to the law, the requirement for "506J notifications" is only in effect during or in
                            anticipation of a declared public health emergency. Since the COVID-19 public health emergency ended
                            on May 11, 2023, the FDA no longer expects manufacturers to submit these notifications for devices
                            deemed critical during that period. However, the FDA accepts and encourages device manufacturers to
                            voluntarily report any interruptions or discontinuances in manufacturing, even outside of declared
                            public health emergencies, as this information is crucial for preventing and managing disruptions in
                            the supply of essential devices (FDA).</p>
        
                        <h3>Management/Production</h3>
                        <p>Cost cutting, manufacturing and quality problems, geopolitical issues.</p>
        
                        <h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>
                        <p>Natural disasters, delays, public health emergencies, and discontinuations (COVID). The recent
                            shortages of small volume parenteral (SVP) IV fluids were driven by the manufacturing disruption
                            from Hurricane Maria superimposed on reduced supply due to manufacturer quality issues. The reduced
                            supply of SVP products, including normal saline, led to widespread disruption in the delivery of
                            healthcare in the US and globally as these products are used for hydration and preparation of
                            numerous additional widely used medications.</p>
                        <p>Until 2017, all 0.9% Sodium Chloride IV bags, also known as Saline Bags, which are required for all
                            patients admitted into the emergency rooms were produced in Puerto Rico. However, in 2014, the U.S.
                            experienced a nationwide shortage of IV solutions, specifically saline large volume intravenous
                            solutions. Manufacturers blamed supply disruptions on plant shutdowns for routine inspection and
                            upgrades. The main manufacturer, Baxter International, went south.</p>

                        <p>The shortage crisis has affected multiple countries, including Mexico, the United Kingdom, and rural
                            areas of China and Australia. It has also impacted various products such as saline bags/infusion
                            pumps.</p>

                        <h2>Products Affected</h2>
                        <h3>Saline Bags/Infusion Pumps</h3>
                        <p>To help alleviate the 2014 shortage, the FDA announced that it was working with the three U.S.
                            manufacturers, Baxter Healthcare, B. Braun Medical, and Hospira, to increase supply. The agency also
                            approved Fresenius Kabi USA to temporarily import its European sodium chloride 0.9% Freeflex
                            Injection Solution for Intravenous Infusion into the U.S. market in late 2014. Then, in May 2015,
                            the FDA approved Baxterâ€™s Sabinanigo, Spain facility as a manufacturing site for 0.9% sodium
                            chloride injection, USP, for the U.S. market. Even with these interventions, the American Society of
                            Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) reported shortages of 0.9% sodium chloride irrigation and 0.45%
                            sodium chloride injection bags throughout 2016 across multiple manufacturers, including B. Braun,
                            Baxter, Hospira, and Pfizer.</p>
        
                        <h3>N95 Masks</h3>
                        <p>When COVID-19 surged in 2020, the resulting shortage of N95 respirator face masks in the U.S.
                            highlighted the complexities of global medical product supply chains, as well as the need for
                            serious modifications to ensure public health and safety. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply
                            chains, resulting in a critical shortage of high-demand PPE, including N95 respirators, worldwide.
                            In many countries, healthcare workers have little choice but to use substandard PPE and respirators,
                            even homemade ones. Similar situations have also occurred during past pandemics and epidemics.
                            National, local, regional, and hospital administrative authorities should have the oversight to
                            monitor the demand for PPE and prioritize the needs of the frontline healthcare workers who are at
                            the highest risks of exposure to the virus.</p>

                    <section id="impact">
                        <h2>Impact on Patient Care</h2>
                        <p>According to a survey, 60% of respondents reported shortages of more than 20 drugs, single-use
                            supplies, or other medical devices in the six months leading up to the survey. The shortage crisis
                            has permeated multiple medical specialties, with 74% of respondents citing compromised care in
                            surgery and anesthetics, 64% in emergency care, 52% in pain management, 45% in cardiology, 44% in
                            hematology and oncology, 39% in infectious diseases, and 37% in obstetrics and gynecology.</p>
                        <p>Disruptions in the medical product supply chain have been an ongoing issue for decades. Although
                            shortages of drugs and medical devices can be life-threatening for some individuals, they also have
                            broader systemic impacts. These shortages put additional strain on manufacturers and suppliers to
                            handle unexpected spikes in demand, ultimately affecting the entire U.S. healthcare system and
                            resulting in costs amounting to millions of dollars annually (National Academies).</p>

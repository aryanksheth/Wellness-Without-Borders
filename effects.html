                <h2>Effects</h2>
                <p>The shortage crisis has affected multiple countries, including Mexico, the United Kingdom, and rural
                    areas of China and Australia. It has also impacted various products such as saline bags/infusion
                    pumps.</p>

                <h2>Products Affected</h2>
                <h3>Saline Bags/Infusion Pumps</h3>
                <p>To help alleviate the 2014 shortage, the FDA announced that it was working with the three U.S.
                    manufacturers, Baxter Healthcare, B. Braun Medical, and Hospira, to increase supply. The agency also
                    approved Fresenius Kabi USA to temporarily import its European sodium chloride 0.9% Freeflex
                    Injection Solution for Intravenous Infusion into the U.S. market in late 2014. Then, in May 2015,
                    the FDA approved Baxterâ€™s Sabinanigo, Spain facility as a manufacturing site for 0.9% sodium
                    chloride injection, USP, for the U.S. market. Even with these interventions, the American Society of
                    Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) reported shortages of 0.9% sodium chloride irrigation and 0.45%
                    sodium chloride injection bags throughout 2016 across multiple manufacturers, including B. Braun,
                    Baxter, Hospira, and Pfizer.</p>

                <h3>N95 Masks</h3>
                <p>When COVID-19 surged in 2020, the resulting shortage of N95 respirator face masks in the U.S.
                    highlighted the complexities of global medical product supply chains, as well as the need for
                    serious modifications to ensure public health and safety. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply
                    chains, resulting in a critical shortage of high-demand PPE, including N95 respirators, worldwide.
                    In many countries, healthcare workers have little choice but to use substandard PPE and respirators,
                    even homemade ones. Similar situations have also occurred during past pandemics and epidemics.
                    National, local, regional, and hospital administrative authorities should have the oversight to
                    monitor the demand for PPE and prioritize the needs of the frontline healthcare workers who are at
                    the highest risks of exposure to the virus.</p>

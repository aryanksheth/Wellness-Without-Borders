                <h2>Impact on Patient Care</h2>
                <p>According to a survey, 60% of respondents reported shortages of more than 20 drugs, single-use
                    supplies, or other medical devices in the six months leading up to the survey. The shortage crisis
                    has permeated multiple medical specialties, with 74% of respondents citing compromised care in
                    surgery and anesthetics, 64% in emergency care, 52% in pain management, 45% in cardiology, 44% in
                    hematology and oncology, 39% in infectious diseases, and 37% in obstetrics and gynecology.</p>
                <p>Disruptions in the medical product supply chain have been an ongoing issue for decades. Although
                    shortages of drugs and medical devices can be life-threatening for some individuals, they also have
                    broader systemic impacts. These shortages put additional strain on manufacturers and suppliers to
                    handle unexpected spikes in demand, ultimately affecting the entire U.S. healthcare system and
                    resulting in costs amounting to millions of dollars annually (National Academies).</p>
